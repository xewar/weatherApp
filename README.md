# weatherApp

A minimalist weather forecasting site

_Project Focus_
Practice using async and await, promise, and XML HttpRequests, and APIs.

_Notes_
This was a fun project. I had an idea for what I wanted it to look like and made a dummy in InDesign before starting. That was the first time I'd done that and it was a helpful guide (rather than trying to iterate the design in CSS).

My biggest challenge was figuring out how to add a moon phase calendar into the site. I was really happy that I was able to figure out how to integrate a tool made by someone else and also convert an XML HttpRequest to a promise as I'd been practicing.

- As you mouse over days show more information about the weather (humidity, uvi, etc.)
- Move the sunrise and sunset to correspond to the length of the day
- As you hover over the days, change the sunrise and sunset times and move the suns
